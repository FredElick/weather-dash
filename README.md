# weather-dash
This app allows you to search by city for weather and logs the result along with city name and 5 day forcast. Previous searches are kept in local storage and loaded as buttons, which will call the same function when pressed but do not log themselves as another prior search. The prior search additions are all done in the search button handler so as to avoid this. There are 2 api's called-one to grab the city info for lat and long and another to turn those into the actual weather info. I had run into some issues on the dates, not sure why this was the case, but converting from UTC proved challenging to say the least.
